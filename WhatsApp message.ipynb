    "In the above script, we have specified the recipient phone number on which we want to send the message, then the message to be sent, and then the time at which the message has to be sent. This function follows the 24 hrs time format, hence the time 18:30 is 06:30 PM.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running the script make sure you are logged in to WhatsApp web in google chrome. To login into WhatsApp web go to this link and scan the QR Code using the mobile phone in which you are using WhatsApp.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now just run the final script to send a WhatsApp message. After running the script, It will let you know that after how many seconds your WhatsApp going to open and what particular time your message would be sent. After that many seconds, this script will automatically open WhatsApp and it will send the message to the specified recipient.\n",

    "2. Specify the minutes’ argument by starting with 0. For instance 6:08 PM as 18, 08. You will get a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "“SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Start your minutes’ argument with a number other than 0.\n",

    "3. If the recipient phone number you want to send a message to doesn’t have a country code. You will get this error:\n",
