    "- The trick is that the neural networks we use as generative models have a number of parameters significantly smaller than the amount of data we train them on, so the models are forced to discover and efficiently internalize the essence of the data in order to generate it.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Generative models have many short-term applications. But in the long run, they hold the potential to automatically learn the natural features of a dataset, whether categories or dimensions or something else entirely.\n",

    "## ChatGPT: ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "## \" Best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public\"\n",
    "- It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ChatGPT â€“ a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) â€“ was fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning[5]) on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning.Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning step, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. For example, it can write and debug computer programs, compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker); write poetry and song lyrics;emulate a Linux system; simulate an entire chat room; play games like tic-tac-toe; and simulate an ATM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT suffers from multiple limitations. \n",
    "OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT \"sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers\". This behavior is common to large language models and is called artificial intelligence hallucination.The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law.\n",

    "\n",
    "### InstructGPT is a GPT-style language model. Researchers at OpenAI developed the model by fine-tuning GPT-3 to follow instructions using human feedback. There are three model sizes: 1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters."
